/// Displays a Material dialog above the current contents of the app, with
/// Material entrance and exit animations, modal barrier color, and modal
/// barrier behavior (dialog is dismissible with a tap on the barrier).
///
/// This function takes a `builder` which typically builds a [Dialog] widget.
/// Content below the dialog is dimmed with a [ModalBarrier]. The widget
/// returned by the `builder` does not share a context with the location that
/// `showDialog` is originally called from. Use a [StatefulBuilder] or a
/// custom [StatefulWidget] if the dialog needs to update dynamically.
///
/// The `context` argument is used to look up the [Navigator] and [Theme] for
/// the dialog. It is only used when the method is called. Its corresponding
/// widget can be safely removed from the tree before the dialog is closed.
///
/// The `child` argument is deprecated, and should be replaced with `builder`.
///
/// Returns a [Future] that resolves to the value (if any) that was passed to
/// [Navigator.pop] when the dialog was closed.
///
/// The dialog route created by this method is pushed to the root navigator.
/// If the application has multiple [Navigator] objects, it may be necessary to
/// call `Navigator.of(context, rootNavigator: true).pop(result)` to close the
/// dialog rather than just `Navigator.pop(context, result)`.
///
/// See also:
///
///  * [AlertDialog], for dialogs that have a row of buttons below a body.
///  * [SimpleDialog], which handles the scrolling of the contents and does
///    not show buttons below its body.
///  * [Dialog], on which [SimpleDialog] and [AlertDialog] are based.
///  * [showCupertinoDialog], which displays an iOS-style dialog.
///  * [showGeneralDialog], which allows for customization of the dialog popup.
